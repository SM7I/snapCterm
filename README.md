ZX Spectrum Terminal

Basics of an ANSI 80 column serial terminal for the plus machines (not IF1 could be compiler for IF1)

Missing ASCii Characters (graphics characters)

ANSI & COLOUR mode work, with colour clash

Strange issue with white paper turning up in places I suspect this it to do with offset column printing instructions from the server.
